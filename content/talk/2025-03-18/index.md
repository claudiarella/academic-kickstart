abstract = "Resurgence provides a powerful toolbox to access the non-perturbative sectors hidden within the divergent asymptotic series of quantum theories. Under some special assumptions, the non-perturbative data extracted via resurgent methods possess intrinsic number-theoretic properties that are deeply rooted in the symmetries and arithmetic of the geometry underlying the quantum theory. The framework of modular resurgence aims to formalise this observation. In this talk, after introducing the basics of modular resurgence, I will consider the TS/ST correspondence for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and focus on the fermionic spectral traces of quantum mirror curves. Here, a complete realisation of the modular resurgence paradigm is found in the spectral theory of local P^2—where the bridge between non-perturbative physics and the arithmetic properties of the geometry takes the form of an exact strong-weak symmetry—and is now being generalised to all local weighted projective spaces. This talk is based on arXiv:2212.10606, 2404.10695, 2404.11550, and work in progress."
