# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Resurgence provides a universal toolbox to access the non-perturbative sectors hidden within the divergent asymptotic series of quantum theories. Under suitable assumptions, the data extracted through resurgent methods exhibit intrinsic number-theoretic and quantum modular properties, reflecting the symmetries of the geometry underlying the quantum theory. The framework of modular resurgence aims to formalise this observation. In this talk, I will describe the emerging bridge between the resurgent and arithmetic structures encoded in the asymptotic expansions of certain q-series that are quantum modular, and I will illustrate it with examples from the spectral theory of quantum operators associated with local weighted projective planes.
