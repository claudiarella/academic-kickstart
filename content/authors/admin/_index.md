# In collaboration with Prof. Francis Brown (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford), I am working on a research project in the field of Motivic Amplitudes investigating the motivic Galois coaction and factorisation theorems in the case of Feynman graphs with non-generic kinematics. 

# In collaboration with Prof. Francesco Riva (Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Geneva), I am working on a research project in the area of Effective Field Theory investigating restrictions on Horndeski theories placed by positivity bounds.
