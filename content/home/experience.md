  title = "Particle Physics Research Internship in Modelling and Programming"
  company = "NA62 @ CERN"
  company_url = "https://na62.web.cern.ch"
  location = "Geneva, Switzerland"
  date_start = "2020-07-01"
  date_end = "2020-09-30"
  description = """
Contributed to the design of an experimental framework for the detection of Dark Sector particles in proton beam dump experiments. Contributed to the implementation of a specific model to exploit the displaced-vertex signal from the secondary muons of NA62 to probe the parameter space of a theoretically conjectured light exotic scalar generated via muon bremsstrahlung. Produced the predicted sensitivity plot using programming language C++ and data analysis software ROOT. NA62 is a proton-on-target collision experiment originally searching for ultra-rare kaon decay at the Super Proton Synchrotron. Its use for Beyond Standard Model searches at low energies is a recent proposal.
