abstract = "Quantizing the mirror curve to a toric Calabi-Yau threefold gives rise to quantum operators whose fermionic spectral traces produce factorially divergent series in the Planck constant and its inverse. These are captured by the Nekrasov-Shatashvili and standard topological strings via the TS/ST correspondence. In this talk, I will discuss the resurgence of these dual asymptotic series and present an exact solution for the spectral trace of local P^2. A full-fledged strong-weak symmetry is at play, exchanging the perturbative/nonperturbative contributions to the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic blocks in the factorization of the spectral trace. This relies on a network of relations connecting the dual regimes and building upon the analytic properties of the L-functions with coefficients given by the Stokes constants and the q-series acting as their generating functions. Finally, I will mention how these results fit into a broader paradigm linking resurgence and quantum modularity. This talk is based on arXiv:2212.10606, 2404.10695, and 2404.11550."
