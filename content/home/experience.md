  title = "Theoretical Particle Physics Research Internship"
  company = "NA62 @ CERN"
  company_url = "https://na62.web.cern.ch"
  location = "Geneva, Switzerland"
  date_start = "2020-07-01"
  date_end = "2020-09-30"
  description = """
Contributed to the design of an experimental framework for the detection of muon-philic light Dark Sector particles in proton beam dump experiments. Implemented a model to exploit the displaced-vertex signal from the secondary muons of NA62-type experiments to probe the parameter space of a theoretically conjectured light exotic scalar generated via muon bremsstrahlung. Produced a sensitivity projection using programming language C++, data analysis software ROOT, and simulation software MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. NA62 is a proton-on-target collision experiment recently searching for Beyond Standard Model physics at low energies at the Super Proton Synchrotron.

  description = """
  Collaborated with Prof Francis Brown (University of Oxford) on the application of motivic Galois theory to the study of Feynman integrals in perturbative QFT, specifically investigating the motivic Galois coaction and factorisation theorems for scalar Feynman graphs with non-generic kinematics. Collaborated with Prof Francesco Riva (University of Geneva) on EFT contraints arising from fundamental assumptions of UV consistency, specifically investigating the restrictions placed by (beyond-)positivity bounds on (beyond-)Horndeski theories of modified gravity. Attended courses on Random Matrix Theory.
