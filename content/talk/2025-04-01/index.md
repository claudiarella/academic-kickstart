# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Perturbative expansions in quantum theory, particularly in quantum field theory and
string theory, are typically factorially divergent due to hidden non-perturbative sectors.
First developed in the 1970s and 80s, the theory of resurgence provides universal
machinery to extract non-perturbative effects, which are encoded in exponentially small
corrections, from the perturbative series itself. Very recently, it has been observed that,
under special assumptions, non-perturbative data accessed via resurgent methods
exhibit intrinsic number-theoretic properties, which appear to be rooted in symmetries
of the geometry underlying the quantum theory. The framework of modular resurgence
aims to formalise this observation. In this talk, I will first introduce the systematic,
algebraic approach of resurgence to the problem of divergences. I will then describe the
emerging bridge between non-perturbative effects and arithmetic structures and
conclude with a concrete example from topological string theory."
