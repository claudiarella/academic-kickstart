# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Resurgence provides a universal toolbox to access the non-perturbative sectors hidden within the divergent asymptotic series of quantum theories. Under suitable assumptions, the data extracted through resurgent methods possess intrinsic number-theoretic and quantum modular properties, reflecting the symmetries of the underlying geometry. The framework of modular resurgence aims to formalise this connection. In this talk, I will describe the emerging bridge between the resurgent and arithmetic structures encoded in the asymptotic expansions of q-series, and illustrate it with examples from the spectral theory of local weighted projective planes.
