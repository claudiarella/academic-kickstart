I’m a graduate student in Theoretical High Energy Physics at the University of Oxford with a strong interest in Algebra and Topology. I'm funded by the scholarship Torno Subito by Regione Lazio (Italy). In 2017-18 I contributed to the positron-on-target experiment PADME at INFN-LNF (Italy).
See the [experiment website][1].
