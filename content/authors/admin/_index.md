# For Short Description:
# [Here][1] is my extended CV.
# [1]: files/cv.pdf

# In collaboration with Prof. Francis Brown (Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford), I am working on a research project in the field of Motivic Amplitudes investigating the motivic Galois coaction and factorisation theorems in the case of Feynman graphs with non-generic kinematics. 

# In collaboration with Prof. Francesco Riva (Department of Theoretical Physics, University of Geneva), I am working on a research project in the area of Effective Field Theory investigating restrictions on Horndeski theories placed by positivity bounds.

I am a graduate student in Mathematical and Theoretical Physics exploring different research areas to probe the most fundamental physical phenomena and their underlying mathematical structures. 

I am currently participating in the Master Class in Mathematical Physics 2019-20 at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, funded by the NCCR SwissMAP Excellence Fellowship. 

Find my CV [here][1].
