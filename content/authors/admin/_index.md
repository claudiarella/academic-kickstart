Iâ€™m a graduate student in Mathematical Physics at the University of Geneva and an Excellence Fellow of the National Centre of Competence in Research SwissMAP, Switzerland. 

In 2017 I contributed to the positron-on-target experiment PADME at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics, National Laboratories of Frascati, Italy. 

In 2019 I started working on Motivic Feynman Amplitudes in the research group of Prof. Francis Brown at Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, UK. 

[Here][1] is my extended CV.
