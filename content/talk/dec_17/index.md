# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "A Monte Carlo simulation of a prototype of PADME's Small-Angle Calorimeter has been implemented with the Geant4 software. Particular attention has been given to the energy and time resolutions of the distribution of Cherenkov photons produced in a PbF2 crystal and converted into photo-electrons through a PMT photocathode and their dependence on the crystal geometry. I will present the resulting characterization of a single PbF2 crystal’s performance."
